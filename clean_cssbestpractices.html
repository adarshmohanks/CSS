    <!-- eight techniques for writing clean and mainainable css -->

    <!-- 1:follow a naming convention
    .nav-bar (kebab case): here 2 words are seprated using a dash.
    .navBar (camel case): here the first word will be in smaller case and the first letter of every other following word should be upper case.
    .NavBar (pascal case): here first letter of every word should be upper case.
    .nav_bar (Underscore): here a underscore is used to seprerate two words.
    -->

    <!-- 2:create logical sections in your stylesheet (logically sepreate them in different containers)
    *basic-styles (sizes etc.)
    *Typography (h1 p etc.)
    *forms (input etc.)
    *navigation-bar -->

    <!-- 3:avoid over specific selectors (reduce selector specificity) -->

    <!-- 4:avoid the !important keyword as much as possible. -->

    <!-- 5:sort css properties. (select all prop-> bring up cmd pallet->sort ) -->

    <!-- 6:take advantage of style inheritance. (give the most common properties to the parent elements and let the childrens inherit it.) -->

    <!-- 7:extract repetitive patterns. -->

    <!-- 8:avoid reprtitive values. (keep it DRY:Dont Repeat Yourself) -->
